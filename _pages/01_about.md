* it says _civil engineer_ on my diploma, but I don't feel like one
* no formal education in programming, it is a hobby of mine
* programming languages I use (in decreasing skill level): Python, Nim, F#
* other interests and hobbies: open source, photography, backgammon, (open street) mapping, Linux, genealogy, (LaTeX) typesetting, etc.



## About these pages

I write mostly in English, but here and there some posts might have some locally interesting stuff written in Croatian.
The themes I cover depend on the things that are currently interesting to me---this can change quite often, but you can expect stuff about programming, data analysis and visualizations, and numerical modelling.

English is not my mother tongue so I apologize for all the writing mistakes.
If you find grammatical or any other mistakes in my posts, you would like give me feedback or comment, feel free to contact me.
