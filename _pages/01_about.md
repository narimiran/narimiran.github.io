## About these pages

I write mostly in English, but here and there some posts might have some locally interesting stuff written in Croatian.
The themes I cover depend on the things that are currently interesting to me --- this can change quite often, but you can expect stuff about programming, data analysis and visualizations, and numerical modeling.

English is not my mother tongue so I apologize for all the writing mistakes.
If you find grammatical or any other mistakes in my posts, you would like give me feedback or comment on a stuff I have written, feel free to contact me.
